AlphaSound
==========

Xbox Alpha Audio codec board project. I switched to re-create this board in KiCad as a learning exercise. Currently there are no known public Eagle or KiCad files. However, there are 2 known builds that have succeeded based on the published Datasheet wolfsonmicro. By Aspect and most popular a PCB made by N64Freak. I have one of the boards from N64Freak. I have no intention of being the first or the best. comments, suggestions or corrections are welcome.
