AlphaSound
==========

Xbox Alpha Audio codec board project.
Ive switched to try recreating this board in KiCad as a learning exercise. currently there are no known public Eagle or KiCad files.
However there are 2 known builds that succeeded based on the Datasheet wolfsonmicro publiced. By Aspect and most popular a PCB made by N64Freak. I got one of the boards from N64Freak. I have no intent to be the first or the best. comments, suggestions or corrections are welcome.

# Goal
Create a full reproduction project file of the WM9707AMR evaluation board.

## Stretch goal
Manufacturer the board and test in (franken)Alpha
